# ESPSomfy

This repository provides an **external ESPHome component** to control Somfy motorised covers (and future device types). It uses a **hub architecture** where radio hardware is configured once in a `somfy:` hub block, and individual devices reference it via `somfy_id`. This makes it easy to add multiple covers sharing a single radio, and to extend with new platforms (switches, lights, etc.) in the future.

Two protocols are supported:

| Type | Protocol | Frequency | Modulation | Use case |
|------|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| `rts` | Somfy RTS | 433.42 MHz | OOK (Manchester) | Standard Somfy remotes/motors |
| `iohc` 1W | io-homecontrol 1W | 868.95 MHz | 2-FSK, 38.4 kbaud | Newer Somfy motors (one-way control) |
| `iohc` 2W | io-homecontrol 2W | 868.25/868.95/869.85 MHz | 2-FSK, 38.4 kbaud | Bidirectional with status feedback |

## Architecture

```
somfy:              ← Hub (owns radio hardware)
  type: rts/iohc

cover:              ← Device (references hub)
  platform: somfy
  somfy_id: <hub>
```

The hub handles all radio TX/RX and protocol framing. Device classes (covers today, more in the future) handle device-specific logic (rolling codes, position tracking, pairing) and delegate radio operations to their hub.

## Required hardware

- **ESP32** (any variant)
- **For RTS:** CC1101 433 MHz module + antenna (via ESPHome `remote_transmitter` / `remote_receiver`)
- **For iohc:** CC1101 868 MHz module + antenna (via ESPHome native `cc1101` component in packet mode), or an SX1276/SX1278-family 868 MHz module (via ESPHome native `sx127x` component, 1W only)

```

### Pairing (PROG)

The ESPHome device acts like a new Somfy RTS remote identified by `remote_code`. Before it can control a motor, that motor must be paired:

1. Put the motor into *programming mode* using an **already paired** physical remote (hold PROG ~2 s until the motor jogs).
2. Within the programming window, press the **Prog …** button in Home Assistant.
3. The motor jogs again to confirm pairing.

### Detecting remote IDs

1. Add a `text_sensor` (as above) and set `detected_remote` on the cover.
2. Press a button on the physical remote.
3. Read the decoded `0x......` ID from the text sensor.
4. Add it to `allowed_remotes` and recompile.

### Notes

- 1W commands (open/close/stop/MY) are sent on **868.95 MHz**. Ordinary commands use the virtual controller's private AES key; the public transfer key is used only to install that key during pairing.
- The component handles CRC-16 (Kermit) and AES-128 HMAC in software.
- STOP and MY are intentionally distinct transmissions even though both use the authenticated `CMD_EXECUTE` main parameter `0xD200`. STOP sends that frame alone, which stops movement but does not recall MY when idle. A dedicated MY action sends that safe stop-only frame first, waits 500 ms for the motor to settle, and then reproduces the real remote's complete short-press sequence: `0xD200`, followed by `cmd=0x20` payloads `02 FF 01 43 02 0C 00 00` and `02 FF 01 43 02 05 FF 00`. Each logical frame has its own rolling code and MAC. MY therefore means “go to the stored favourite” whether the motor was moving or idle, without relying on Home Assistant's estimated state.
- `my_position` only tells Home Assistant where to animate the 1W position estimate when MY recall begins; it is not used to choose the RF command.
- `allowed_remotes` lets commands from already-paired physical remotes update the time-based Home Assistant estimate. An empty list accepts all decoded remote IDs; an explicit list is safer after discovery. `detected_remote` includes the received rolling sequence and an event number, so repeated presses of the same button remain separate Home Assistant history entries while RF copies from one burst are collapsed.
- On Venetian remotes, a wheel gesture can intentionally stop lift movement
  with a `D200` frame before sending its direction-bearing tilt event. The
  receiver correlates that pair into one tilt action for Home Assistant; a
  genuine standalone STOP/MY remains visible and functional. Larger wheel
  rolls carry a signed magnitude around `0xCCE8`; received rolls are converted
  to an estimated effective step count. Home Assistant tilt transmission uses
  hardware-verified two-step compound gestures plus an exact one-step remainder
  instead of unsafe arbitrary-size synthetic rolls.
- For bidirectional (2W) support, see the next section.

### Receive-only raw capture (experimental)

`somfy_iohc_capture` is a diagnostic component for investigating commands from
real io-homecontrol remotes before implementing new device types. It has no
controller key, rolling-code storage, transmit method, pairing action or API
service. Every CRC-valid RF copy is published separately; do not press PROG
during a capture.

Include `somfy_iohc_capture` in the `external_components` list and add:

```yaml
somfy_iohc_capture:
  id: iohc_raw_capture
  somfy_id: iohc_radio
  # Optional after the first capture. Omit to hear every valid iohc frame.
  # remote_code: 0x112233
  capture:
    name: "IOHC Raw Frame Capture"
```

The diagnostic state and the `somfy.iohc.capture` INFO log contain a unique
event number, source/destination, command ID, both frame-control bytes, RSSI,
LQI, complete command data, and the complete logical frame. Raw frames contain
controller identifiers and authenticated values, so treat captures as private
diagnostic material.

<summary><h2>iohc configuration on an SX1276 (1W only)</h2></summary>

The io-homecontrol hub can use an SX1276-family transceiver through ESPHome's
native `sx127x` component instead of a CC1101. Replace `cc1101_id` with
`sx127x_id`; covers are configured exactly as in the CC1101 section above.
A complete example is in [`somfy_iohc_sx1276.yaml`](somfy_iohc_sx1276.yaml).

```yaml
spi:
  clk_pin: GPIO4
  mosi_pin: GPIO5
  miso_pin: GPIO6

sx127x:
  id: sx1276_radio
  cs_pin: GPIO7
  rst_pin: GPIO15
  dio0_pin: GPIO16          # required: packet received / packet sent
  frequency: 868.95MHz
  modulation: FSK
  bitrate: 38400
  deviation: 19.2kHz
  bandwidth: 125_0kHz
  bitsync: true
  packet_mode: true
  crc_enable: false
  payload_length: 60        # RX capture window in bytes
  sync_value: [0x57, 0xFD]
  preamble_polarity: 0x55
  preamble_size: 64         # transmit preamble in bytes, at least 24
  preamble_detect: 2
  pa_pin: BOOST
  pa_power: 17
  rx_start: true

somfy:
  - id: iohc_radio
    type: iohc
    sx127x_id: sx1276_radio
    # wake_preamble: 254ms    # optional, see below
```

The settings marked by the config check (`modulation`, `bitrate`, `deviation`,
`sync_value`, `preamble_polarity`, `packet_mode`, `bitsync`, `crc_enable`,
`rx_start`, a fixed `payload_length`, `preamble_size` of at least 24 and a
`dio0_pin`) are required; a wrong value is rejected when the config is
validated. `bandwidth`, `preamble_detect` and the PA settings are yours to tune.

**Preamble length.** A physical Situo io remote, measured with an SDR, sends
64 bytes of preamble before each repeat and about 254 ms (roughly 1220 bytes)
before the first copy of a burst, the one that carries the wake bit.
`preamble_size: 64` matches the repeats. The optional hub setting
`wake_preamble` (up to 2 s) makes the first copy use a long preamble as well,
for receivers that need it to wake up; it costs one more radio
reconfiguration per command and blocks for the length of the preamble.

Differences from the CC1101 backend:

- **1W only.** `mode: 2w` covers are rejected on an `sx127x_id` hub: the native
  component resets the chip on every reconfiguration (about 18 ms on an
  ESP32-S3), far longer than the 2.7 ms 2W channel dwell.
- **No signal strength.** The native component reports no RSSI in FSK mode, so
  RSSI reads 0 in logs and diagnostics.
- **Each transmit burst** costs one radio reconfiguration before and one after
  it, during which the hub does not listen.

Status: reception of a physical Situo io remote and the transmitted signal
(deviation, bit rate, framing, checked with an SDR) are verified on an
ESP32-S3 with an SX1276. Control of a motor through this backend is not yet
confirmed.

<summary><h2>iohc GUI commissioning (multiple independent shutters)</h2></summary>

`somfy_iohc_manager` turns one ESP32 + CC1101 into a reusable bridge with up
to 20 independently controlled 1W shutter identities by default. Shutters are
added from Home Assistant's UI; adding the second or later shutter does not
require a YAML edit or another firmware build. Install one bridge per radio
coverage zone and add each bridge separately to the HA integration.

The manager deliberately creates a unique controller address, AES key, rolling
code stream, physical-remote allow-list, opening time, closing time, and MY
position for every shutter. It also maintains an AES-GCM encrypted controller
backup after every transmitted rolling code.

### ESPHome

Enable custom API actions, add the manager component, create its two diagnostic
text sensors, and configure a separate 16-byte backup-encryption key:

```yaml
api:
  custom_services: true

external_components:
  source: github://leonardpitzu/esphome_somfy@main
  components: [somfy, somfy_iohc_manager]

text_sensor:
  - platform: template
    id: commissioning_status
    name: "Commissioning Status"
    entity_category: diagnostic
  - platform: template
    id: encrypted_controller_backup
    name: "Encrypted Controller Backup"
    entity_category: diagnostic

somfy_iohc_manager:
  id: shutter_manager
  somfy_id: iohc_radio
  status_sensor: commissioning_status
  backup_sensor: encrypted_controller_backup
  backup_key: !secret somfy_io_backup_key  # exactly 32 hex characters
  max_shutters: 20
```

The `somfy:` hub, SPI bus, and packet-mode CC1101 block are the same as in the
1W example above. See `tests/fixtures/test_iohc_manager.yaml` for a complete
compilable example.

An already-paired controller can be migrated into any chosen slot without any
pairing RF by adding it under `imports:`. Preserve its existing
`storage_namespace` and `storage_key`: the live NVS value remains authoritative
and the YAML `initial_rolling_code` is used only if that NVS key is absent.

The Home Assistant forms use one-based slot numbers **1–20**. Slot moves copy
the controller address, AES key, remote allow-list, calibration and rolling-code
storage reference without transmitting RF. The old slot is disabled and made
durable before the destination is created, so an interrupted move cannot leave
two transmit-capable copies of one controller identity.

Two occupied managed slots can also be swapped directly, without a spare slot.
Before either NVS slot is overwritten, the firmware commits a journal containing
both complete original records and disables both runtime transmitters. Boot-time
recovery can replay that journal after a power loss. The GUI exchanges the two
slot numbers while keeping each shutter's Somfy device, name, area, calibration,
encrypted backup, controller key and rolling-code stream with the same physical
shutter. A swap emits no RF and never needs PROG.

Physical group selections can use an additional receive-only controller
identity. On the hardware-tested Situo 5, **All channels** sends one broadcast
command from that group identity rather than one command for every motor. The
manager stores up to 32 group aliases, each targeting up to 32 managed
shutters. A shutter may belong to multiple aliases. Membership is stored by
permanent controller node identity, so it follows shutters through slot moves
and swaps.

Group discovery accepts only a broadcast OPEN or CLOSE from the physical
remote and stages it until Home Assistant confirms the complete target list.
Adding, editing, or removing an alias sends no RF, never presses PROG, and does
not consume a motor pairing slot. Independent bridge control still uses each
shutter's own paired controller identity; aliases only synchronize received
physical commands to all assigned state estimates. One received group command
is published with its complete target-slot list, so Home Assistant updates
every member without losing intermediate status to state coalescing.

Simultaneous managed MY requests are serialized as complete transactions.
Each shutter receives its uninterrupted STOP, extended execute, press, and
release sequence; the next queued shutter starts after the release burst and a
20 ms radio handoff gap. Duplicate pending MY targets are coalesced because MY
is an idempotent destination. This queue currently covers managed MY requests;
a general scheduler for movement, timed STOP, and Venetian transactions remains
future work.

The experimental multi-bridge manager extends that model without duplicating
controller identities. Every bridge publishes normalized physical-remote
observations, while Home Assistant deduplicates them and forwards only
estimator updates to an owner that missed RF. A shutter may also use one
stateless secondary transmitter for OPEN, CLOSE, and STOP: the secondary
replays the primary's exact authenticated frame and rolling sequence from a
short-lived, challenge-bound envelope, and never receives the controller key.
Guarded cross-bridge ownership transfer archives and hard-disables the source
before activating the same identity on the destination. See
[`docs/iohc-multi-bridge.md`](docs/iohc-multi-bridge.md) for the protocol,
failure rules, and two-radio validation checklist.

### Home Assistant

Install the companion
[Somfy IO Shutter Manager](https://github.com/Jordi-14/homeassistant_somfy_io_manager)
custom integration through HACS. It provides graphical pairing, import,
calibration, slot moves, occupied-slot swaps, encrypted recovery, per-shutter
devices, native MY controls, physical-group assignment, and physical-remote
diagnostics.

The physical PROG press cannot be automated: it is the motor's proof that an
already-authorized controller approved the new identity. The wizard sends the
new pairing frame exactly once after explicit confirmation. It persists the
uncertain `pair_sent` state before emitting any pairing RF, so even a power loss
at that boundary cannot trigger an automatic retry. If the second jog is
uncertain, it preserves that identity and offers a resume path instead of
blindly generating or retransmitting controllers.

The firmware status contract is versioned. This manager emits API version `1`;
compatible Home Assistant integration releases validate that version before
using manager events.

Do not run the same restored controller identity on two powered bridges. A
rolling-code identity has one owner; switch the old bridge off before moving a
backup to replacement hardware.

<summary><h2>iohc configuration (2W — bidirectional)</h2></summary>

2W mode enables authenticated bidirectional communication with io-homecontrol actuators. The controller sends a command, the actuator replies with a cryptographic challenge, and the controller responds to prove it holds the system key. This provides command acknowledgement and status feedback.

### Requirements

- ESPHome 2026.4+ with native `cc1101` component in packet mode
- The **system key** (per-installation AES-128 key) — obtained during initial pairing or from a paired controller backup
- The actuator's **node address** (3-byte, e.g. `0xABCDEF`)

### Protocol overview

1. Controller sends CMD_EXECUTE (0x00) on 868.95 MHz
2. Actuator replies with challenge (CMD 0x3C, 6 random bytes) on one of 3 RX channels (868.25 / 868.95 / 869.85 MHz)
3. Controller computes AES-128-ECB response from IV (frame data + rolling checksum + challenge) and sends CMD 0x3D
4. Actuator validates and executes; sends status (CMD 0xFE) back

### Example configuration

```yaml
somfy:
  - id: iohc_radio
    type: iohc
    cc1101_id: cc1101_radio

cover:
  - platform: somfy
    type: iohc
    id: living_room_blind
    name: "Living Room Blind"
    device_class: shutter
    open_duration: 25s
    close_duration: 25s
    storage_key: KeyLivBlind
    remote_code: 0xAABBCC
    prog_button: program_living_room
    somfy_id: iohc_radio
    mode: 2w
    target_node: 0xDEADBE
    encryption_key: "YOUR_SYSTEM_KEY_HEX_32_CHARS_HERE"
```

### Additional cover options (2W)

| Option | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `mode` | no | `1w` (default) or `2w` |
| `target_node` | 2W only | 3-byte hex address of the target actuator |
| `encryption_key` | 2W only | System key (32-char hex AES-128 key) |

### Notes

- TX is always on **868.95 MHz**; RX hops across 3 channels (868.25 / 868.95 / 869.85 MHz) with 2.7 ms dwell time.
- The session has a 3-second timeout with up to 2 retries.
- Unlike 1W, 2W frames do not use a rolling code — authentication is challenge/response based.
- The system key is specific to your installation. It is **not** the public transfer key used by 1W.

## Invert direction

Home Assistant's "open" sends the remote's Up, which is right for a shutter.
On an awning Up retracts, while Home Assistant shows an open awning as
extended, so the entity ends up reversed. `invert_direction: true` on the
cover swaps the two, for both RTS and iohc:

- open sends Down / close, close sends Up / open; stop and My are unchanged;
- a physical remote's Up is shown as closing, Down as opening;
- `open_duration`, `close_duration` and `my_position` stay in Home
  Assistant's terms: `open_duration` is how long HA's open takes.

To change it without reflashing, add the switch. Its stored state wins over
the cover's YAML value once it has been used:

```yaml
cover:
  - platform: somfy
    type: rts
    id: awning
    invert_direction: true
    # ...

switch:
  - platform: somfy
    cover_id: awning
    name: "Invert Direction"
```

Toggling the switch stops a running movement and mirrors the shown position
(30% becomes 70%): the motor has not moved, only the meaning of the scale.

## Adding shutters safely

Each independently controlled shutter needs its own cover block and calibration. Record all of the following next to that block:

- a stable `id` and entity `name`;
- measured `open_duration` and `close_duration`;
- measured `my_position` and a dedicated `my_button` when the motor has a MY favourite;
- a unique virtual-controller `remote_code` and private `encryption_key`;
- a unique `storage_namespace`/`storage_key` pair and the next known unused `initial_rolling_code`;
- the physical remote ID(s) in `allowed_remotes` for state synchronisation.

Never reuse a `remote_code` or NVS storage key between independent cover entities. One controller identity may intentionally be paired with several shutters, but its broadcast commands will move all of them together; model that as one group cover rather than duplicate entities.

To calibrate a shutter, first drive it fully closed. Time one uninterrupted trip to fully open, then time one uninterrupted trip back to fully closed, and add a small allowance (typically a few tenths of a second) so the estimate reaches the end stop. From a known end stop, recall MY and calculate its percentage from elapsed travel divided by the corresponding full-travel time. Verify 25%, 50%, 75%, MY, physical-remote sync, reboot persistence, and both end stops before relying on automations.

The position is dead reckoning, not motor feedback, in 1W mode. End-stop runs correct accumulated error. A factory erase, renamed NVS key, changed controller ID/key, or accidental PROG operation can lose or consume a scarce pairing slot; back up those values before flashing or replacing hardware.
